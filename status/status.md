Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I began my progress on the final project by drafting a flowchart in Adobe Photoshop, which visually subdivided the application into a model,
view, and controller. I also used this as an opportunity to make note of which pages the interface would be composed of and
preceded to outline which technologies would be serviceable for each component of the MVC model
(SQLite, Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS/JS). After getting an idea of the flow of the application from a high-level perspective,
I began working on mock-ups of the graphical interface in Adobe XD. This step was useful because it provided an opportunity for me to think
critically into what data I would collect and which forms would be used at each stage of the user experience. From this point, I set-up my repository and
began working on programming the landing page, paying particularly close attention to its style and content. The registration and sign-in forms are currently not
in place but need to be wired to the bank-end. I also designed some rough layouts for the reviewal page and took the chance to research information
on the upperclassmen houses.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Going forward, now that I have developed a more coherent plan for the webapp and configured the layout of a few pages,
I will start by figuring out the structure of my database and begin programming the logic for my routes in Python. I will need to
hash the user's credentials for secure storage in the back-end, as well as ensure that there are necessary checks put in place on the data entered
into the database. My next task will be to finish laying out the rating and reviewal pages for upperclassmen houses and write an algorithm for
the ranking system. I will also work on a storymap for users unaffiliated with an upperclassmen house or who are simply there to view other reviews
as opposed to leaving their own. After implementation, I would like to polish the stylization of the site and pay greater attention to making the
user experience as streamline as possible.


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One of the problems I encountered initially was finding non-copyrighted images of upperclassmen houses for the interface. Another was the creation of a logo for the website, which proved to be challenging from a design standpoint.
