# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Harvard College Upperclassmen Housing: A Student Hub for Rankings and Reviews

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is a web application that intakes student reviews of upperclassmen houses and aggregates the data collected for each house.
The numerical ratings and written reviews will be summarized on a page corresponding to each house so that the blocking groups on housing
day can find out more information about their assignments.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The web application will provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for students to learn about their upperclassmen housing options, helping
to reduce the lack of transparency that blocking groups face when finding out their assignments. To bring this vision to fruition, the software
will facilitate the creation and storage of user accounts in a SQL database. For every user, I hope to record a name, ID number, college email,
and housing assignment (if one has been granted yet). The software will also hash their password for secure storage.

After signing up, the website will account for one of two possibilities: either the user has already been assigned a house and is leaving
feedback on their living experience, or the user just received their assignment and is browsing past reviews left on the website. For the first option,
a form will collect reflections from the user about their experience (both on a 1-5 scale and through the form of text fields where they can enter written
comments). In the case of the second option, the user will be able to visit a page for each upperclassmen house and read about students' experiences
with it. By supporting the functionality for this review system, the web application will help break down the communication barriers that stand in between current
and rising upperclassmen, thereby elucidating an honest picture of what it looks like to live on campus.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Does not apply

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The portal will allow the user to sign-up with their Harvard email (by persistently storing their credentials in a database), rate their upperclassmen house, and view the numerical averages for each house.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to numerical ratings, the portal will allow the user to submit reviews in written form of their upperclassmen house and edit past comments that they have submitted.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

IF time permits, the web application will feature an interactive map showing where the houses are located and providing pictures of each dorm.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Moving forward, I would like to start by drafting up visual mock-ups of the user interface in Adobe XD. This iterative design process will
help me understand from a user interface and user experience perspective what data I can expect to collect and how that may be presented to users.
After getting a sense for the layout, I want to draft up a systems design diagram in Photoshop which uses the MVC model to compartmentalize the
different features of the application. During this time, I will also review the lecture and quiz on web programming to familiarize myself with
which technologies and frameworks I can use. I'll need to do more research on Python, Flask, and hosting options before beginning development.
